QA requires EDB to be installed.  It has been tested w/ EDB 1.25.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install, follow these steps:

(1) Unpack the distribution.

	gzip -dc qa-X.Y.tar.gz | tar xf -

(2) Configure for your system.

	cd qa-X.Y
	./configure	# default prefix is /usr/local

(3) Build the package.

	make

(4) Install.  This process copies qa.el to `lispdir', which is normally
    something like /usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp.

	make install

    Additionally, these files are copied to these directories:

	file		directory
	----------	---------------
	data files	PREFIX/share/qa
	qa.info		PREFIX/info
	qa.html		PREFIX/share/qa

    To install qa.el in a different place, use `lispdir=DIR', like so:

	make install lispdir=/home/ttn/elisp
