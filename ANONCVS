Anonymous CVS is available for the "qa" module.
Here are the commands to use:

  rootopt='-d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.glug.org:/home/ttn/cvsroot'

  cvs $rootopt login    # just type RET at the prompt

  cvs $rootopt co qa

Look at autogen.sh to get started.

Here are some cvs tags and their meanings:

  v-0-7 -- release 0.7
  v-0-8 -- release 0.8

Happy hacking!
